## üß† Problem Statement

Customer churn directly impacts recurring revenue and profitability. The objective of this project is to **predict which customers are likely to churn** and to provide **data-driven strategies** for reducing churn and preserving lifetime value (LTV).

## üìÇ Project Overview

| Phase                     | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Business Understanding    | Defined churn problem and goals aligned with stakeholder needs             |
| Exploratory Data Analysis | Uncovered churn patterns by contract type, payment method, age group, etc. |
| Feature Engineering       | Created behavioral and financial indicators (e.g., Engagement Score)        |
| Model Building            | Trained Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost on 3 dataset versions |
| Evaluation                | Used precision, recall, and F1-score to focus on churn prediction quality   |
| Business Impact           | Estimated model-driven churn reduction of **7.34%** and retention of **$317K+** in LTV |

## üîç EDA Analysis & Key Insights

- **High churn rates** were observed among:
  - Month-to-month contract users
  - Solo customers not enrolled in group plans
  - Customers paying via Direct Debit or Paper Check
- **Higher monthly charges and frequent customer service calls** were strong predictors of churn.
- **Younger customers (<30) and seniors** showed slightly elevated churn risks.
- **Unlimited data plan users** also churned at a higher rate than expected, indicating potential dissatisfaction.
- **Business Segments Identified** for targeted retention campaigns based on churn drivers and LTV risk.

## ü§ñ Modeling Approach

Three models were tested across multiple dataset versions (full data, feature-selected, and feature-engineered):

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost (final selected model)

Focus was placed on maximizing **recall and F1-score for churners** to prioritize early intervention and revenue preservation.

## üìà Business Impact

- **Estimated Churn Reduction**: 7.34%  
- **Estimated Revenue Retention**: ~$317,000  
- **Model Recall**: 81% (catching majority of true churners)
- **Precision**: 85% (avoiding unnecessary interventions)

The model enables efficient retention targeting and protects customer lifetime value through early churn risk detection.

## üìà Results Summary

- **Best Model**: XGBoost  
- **Accuracy**: 91.13%  
- **Precision (Churn)**: 85%  
- **Recall (Churn)**: 81%  
- **F1 Score (Churn)**: 83%
