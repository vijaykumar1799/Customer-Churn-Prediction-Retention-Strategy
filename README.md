# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Strategy

This project presents a full end-to-end data science solution to a **real-world churn problem** in the telecommunications industry. It includes business-driven data exploration, churn segmentation, model development, and actionable recommendations — packaged in a professional executive report and supported by machine learning deployment.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Customer churn directly impacts recurring revenue and profitability. The objective of this project is to **predict which customers are likely to churn** and to provide **data-driven strategies** for reducing churn and preserving lifetime value (LTV).

## 📂 Project Overview

| Phase                     | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Business Understanding    | Defined churn problem and goals aligned with stakeholder needs             |
| Exploratory Data Analysis | Uncovered churn patterns by contract type, payment method, age group, etc. |
| Feature Engineering       | Created behavioral and financial indicators (e.g., Engagement Score)        |
| Model Building            | Trained Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost on 3 dataset versions |
| Evaluation                | Used precision, recall, and F1-score to focus on churn prediction quality   |
| Business Impact           | Estimated model-driven churn reduction of **7.34%** and retention of **$317K+** in LTV |
